## Create your file
Either clone this repo or create your own file. 

Here the script is in `multi-date-calendar.sh` and the data that it reads is in the data folder: `data/report.txt`

## Make your script executable
In the terminal, go into the directory where you saved your script file. Run:

```sh
chmod +x multi-date-calendar.sh
```

Now you can run the script by typing:

```sh
./multi-date-calendar.sh
```
